        <p className="p-5 max-w-3xl text-left">
          I'm Julia, Chef/Owner/One Woman Show of JJ HINGS, a Pastry Chef/Ice
          Cream Maker!

          I'm passionate about using fresh, responsibly sourced ingredients and
          making flavour combinations inspired by the tastes I grew up with and
          the people I love.

          JJ HINGS is named for Jean and Jackson Hing, my grandmother and great
          uncle. Our family has a long tradition of growing and working with the
          freshest produce.

          My beautiful logo, designed by the talented @isaacstillart and brought
          to life by the amazing @bee_brown.indd, is a recreation of the logo
          from my great-grandfatherâ€™s market garden business (vegetable
          farming), which you can see on their truck!
